      <p>A post-war dystopian society is recognized by the distinct lack of lively human activity. The air is saturated with militaristic engagements meant to monitor and subdue all freedoms whatsoever.</p>   
    <h1> Showcase Work and Reflections</h1>
    <p>GENRE REMIX PHOTOSHOP (MOVIE POSTER)</p>
<p>If I could reimagine the movie poster genre project and complete it on my own, I would have chosen to recreate the movie poster into a classic black and while film. This change would better integrate with the color scheme on my website and specifically the Work in Progress 2 page that it resides in. Not only do I admire the classic movie poster look, it would also become a more cohesive set with the other project assignment images which are mostly black and white color themed as well. The current bold and multicolored poster made by my group and I is a jarring contrast to the rest of my page and looks rather out of place. Revising as if to be viewed by an expert, I think the photoshopping would need to improve in that the skin tones and facial angles would need to align with more precision. </p>
    <p>WEBSITE IN GENERAL</p>
<p>My website is a great example of how I made choices regarding color, fonts, scale, and more. I purposefully chose a grey and pink aesthetic because I enjoyed the way the colors worked with each other and still maintained a clean and functional design without clutter. Pink is utilized throughout to signify an active state, either by highlighting the link or hovering the mouse over one. Pink is also used as a background to my header image which further gives the color defined importance. The font was chosen to be easily legible. If under different circumstances I would explore fonts for my website more as that is a whole other form of design expression that I wasn't able to fully experiment with. If my knowledge of css, java, and HTML were broader I would play around with more unique and expressive design layouts and features. I would probably incorporate motion into my website and more interactive features. I would also pay more attention to responsive design that would allow the website to scale appropriately when being viewed on a mobile device. 
 </p>
    <p>EXPECTATION PHOTOSHOP (CORONA)</p>
<p>This assignment started off with me going through old advertisements and comparing them to any visions that I had in my mind when doing so. As soon as I saw the corona typewriter advertisement, I immediately compared the name to our current pandemic, Coronavirus. I chose this particular comparison because I enjoy satire and I imagined that it would be quite humorous to create an advertisement for coronavirus based on the dialogue and imagery used in the corona typewriter advert. While working on the assignment, I constantly compared the coronavirus advert to the old typewriter advert to ensure that I was satirizing the text in a way that paid homage to the original yet stayed relevant to my intended message. I also constantly compared the fonts, spacing, style, positioning, colors, and more when creating the coronavirus advertisement to once again, stay true to the original advert. I think that the comparison could be made more effective if custom graphics such as an old-time illustrated virus graphic were used instead of the original typewriter visual. This would’ve maintained all the original styles of the corona typewriter advertisement while updating everything to be coronavirus related.</p>
   <p>LOGO PHOTOSHOP (MATAERO)</p>
<p>Even though visually, the Mataero logo assignment looks relatively simple, this assignment actually took me more time than I thought I would. Thinking of my dream company wasn’t very difficult as I knew space mining would undoubtedly be the most profitable company if feasible in our modern day. However, I met the first challenge when creating a name. I knew that the name of the company would affect the logo greatly because from the start, I had wanted to incorporate the shapes and forms of the letters as part of the graphic. Eventually, I concluded on Mataero because it sounds like material but uses the spelling of aero to indicate space. I initially created a logo of a drill on a planet surface but decided to scrap that because it looked cheap and undeserving of a company potentially worth trillions. Eventually I used the double “A”s as rocket thrusters for a drill and was satisfied. I learned that it is alright to throw away an idea and start again even if it means taking more time to create a better piece of work. </p>
     <p>STORYBOARD (EXPECTATION EFFECTS)</p>
<p>I am particularly proud of my documentary storyboard because it incorporates subtle aspects of humor while illustrating the story. More often than not, documentaries can seem boring and are more attributed to lectures accompanied by narration. However, I wanted to approach this assignment with the intention to create a documentary that was both informative about the expectation effect and entertaining at the same time. Using blunt narrative progression and making light of controversial subjects in the real world, I think I achieved this target relatively well. That is why I am proud of it. In the future, I would want to adapt my use of subtle humor into other projects that I work on where appropriate. Humor seems to be underrated and when used in moderation at the right places, can really enhance not just a storyboard but any project it is incorporated in. I believe that this will separate a boring presentation from one that pulls in the intended audience and creates an actual enjoyable experience instead. </p>
 <h1> Reflection Essay </h1>  
    <p>	Going through this class, I started out as a beginner to the subject of web design. This class has not only increased my knowledge in HTML and coding but has also pushed my problem-solving skills as I wrestled with the challenges that come with meticulous coding. Such challenges included creating a functional and synchronous menu bar, making sure links are working correctly and formatting the layout of each page. My favorite part of the classwork this semester was the creative aspect of many of the projects we worked on. This stems from having some creative background before attending the class. This helped me tremendously for many of the assignments. Specifically, this helped with a lot of the photoshop assignments and the design elements of creating my website. 
There were four photoshop assignments that I tackled for the class. Photoshop assignment one consisted of creating something new from an older advertisement. I chose an old typewriter advertisement and decided to create a parody in light of our current pandemic. The second photoshop assignment consisted of taking the assigned genre, comedy, and choosing a movie within that genre, we chose Step Brothers. We were then given the genre of Superhero movies and chose Thor and Loki from the Marvel universe to photoshop into in the Step Brothers movie poster. The third assignment was to create a documentary storyboard, I decided to use my Pecha Kucha topic on expectation effect and reimagined my PowerPoint as a documentary and created that vision with photoshop. Lastly, photoshop assignment four was to create a logo for an imagined company. My imagined company was called Mataero industries which was a space mining company. I had the logo incorporate the letters of the name into the visual representation of a drill. 
We also worked on two writing activities. The first one is called embedded fiction where I chose to fictionalize an Amazon review as a form of satire. The second one is where I described my design concept for my website. My design concept initially started as one thing and evolved over time as I progressively added to my website, which leads into how I revised my website. </p> 
<p>Unfortunately, I did not receive a peer review for my website so I decided to continue by using my own best judgment. To me, revision is when I take a step back to look at my work as a whole and see if any elements individually do not work within the environment altogether. Then, I find a solution to best address that. For example, I originally thought that the navigation bar would benefit by having the current page tab be shifted upwards in position when on that current page. However, I realized that this created inconsistency and rather stuck out oddly. I subsequently removed that feature and had the navigation tabs stay static. Another example is that I went through the entire page to ensure that the use of color was consistent throughout and made changes where the color did not adhere to the design language. </p>
<p> I think it is best to first define my imagined target audience. My target audience includes employers with an eye for aesthetic and detail. Ideally, this target audience would be able to pick up on and appreciate the design details I had included. I have framed my website in a way to simulate a viewing gallery and intend for the imagined audience to have a positive visual experience. Lidwell mentions in “Universal Principles of Design” that positive framing is used to move people to action.  That being said, I hope to provoke some sort of conversation and have the audience ponder upon why certain choices were made when creating either the website as a whole or individual piece of works that are being showcased. I have taken this imagined target audience into account when creating my website by making sure to pay attention to the axis or orientation referenced in The Gutenberg Diagram. Much of my content is a representation of an idea or message. With that in mind, either consciously or subsciously, I have tailored my assignments and work to express myself and best represent the assigned ideas through either a semantic or visual format. </p> 
<p> An important technique to my work would definitely be some degree of humor through satire. For the assignments where creative liberties were allowed, I enjoyed using satire to complete the work. The Corona typewriter advert that was converted into a Coronavirus advert is a great example of this. The Amazon review is another example of this. Both these assignments allowed me to not only complete the assignment but also enjoy it at the same time. I also believe that utilizing satire as part of my profile helps express who I am as a way of sending a message as stated in the previous paragraph. Another aspect that is important to my work would probably be the use of color, or lack thereof when considering most of the photoshop assignments. I strive and prefer to keep a clean and functional aesthetic when designing my website. Whether intentionally or unintentionally, this extended its way into my work as most of my photoshop assignments are simply in black and white. There is one exception due to that being a group project where everyone’s design input was considered, not just my own.</p>
<p> Starting out, my goals were to learn something new and apply that to other aspects of my life. Although this class wasn’t extremely writing focused, my intentions were to learn about the concept of composing in a digital space and age. Web design is something I consider very enjoyable due to the infinite customization options. Although my developer skills aren’t the best, this class definitely helped me create a website that I would not have been able to do on my own and I am proud of that. This also extends to the photoshop assignments. Learning Photoshop was great and I also feel proud of the works I produced using that program. An underestimated area that I was surprised by was writing about my work. This allowed me to really think about the reason for everything I was creating and analyze my work to a deeper level. I would like to continue to improve my web development skills and also continue to write about my work as I believe it greatly improves the produced outcome. </p>
