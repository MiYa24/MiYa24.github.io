    <h2>My Portfolio</h2>
    <h1> Soundscape</h1>
     <li><a href="../">static/Dystopia.wav</a></li>
     <p>A post-war dystopian society is recognized by the distinct lack of lively human activity. The air is saturated with militaristic engagements meant to monitor and subdue all freedoms whatsoever.</p>   
    <h1> Revised work and reflections</h1>
    <p>GENRE REMIX PHOTOSHOP (MOVIE POSTER)</p>
<p>If I could reimagine the movie poster genre project and complete it on my own, I would have chosen to recreate the movie poster into a classic black and while film. This change would better integrate with the color scheme on my website and specifically the Work in Progress 2 page that it resides in. Not only do I admire the classic movie poster look, it would also become a more cohesive set with the other project assignment images which are mostly black and white color themed as well. The current bold and multicolored poster made by my group and I is a jarring contrast to the rest of my page and looks rather out of place. Revising as if to be viewed by an expert, I think the photoshopping would need to improve in that the skin tones and facial angles would need to align with more precision. </p>
    <p>WEBSITE IN GENERAL</p>
<p>My website is a great example of how I made choices regarding color, fonts, scale, and more. I purposefully chose a grey and pink aesthetic because I enjoyed the way the colors worked with each other and still maintained a clean and functional design without clutter. Pink is utilized throughout to signify an active state, either by highlighting the link or hovering the mouse over one. Pink is also used as a background to my header image which further gives the color defined importance. The font was chosen to be easily legible. If under different circumstances I would explore fonts for my website more as that is a whole other form of design expression that I wasn't able to fully experiment with. If my knowledge of css, java, and HTML were broader I would play around with more unique and expressive design layouts and features. I would probably incorporate motion into my website and more interactive features. I would also pay more attention to responsive design that would allow the website to scale appropriately when being viewed on a mobile device.

    <p>EXPECTATION PHOTOSHOP (CORONA)</p>
<p>This assignment started off with me going through old advertisements and comparing them to any visions that I had in my mind when doing so. As soon as I saw the corona typewriter advertisement, I immediately compared the name to our current pandemic, Coronavirus. I chose this particular comparison because I enjoy satire and I imagined that it would be quite humorous to create an advertisement for coronavirus based on the dialogue and imagery used in the corona typewriter advert. While working on the assignment, I constantly compared the coronavirus advert to the old typewriter advert to ensure that I was satirizing the text in a way that paid homage to the original yet stayed relevant to my intended message. I also constantly compared the fonts, spacing, style, positioning, colors, and more when creating the coronavirus advertisement to once again, stay true to the original advert. I think that the comparison could be made more effective if custom graphics such as an old-time illustrated virus graphic were used instead of the original typewriter visual. This would’ve maintained all the original styles of the corona typewriter advertisement while updating everything to be coronavirus related.</p>
   <p>LOGO PHOTOSHOP (MATAERO)</p>
<p>Even though visually, the Mataero logo assignment looks relatively simple, this assignment actually took me more time than I thought I would. Thinking of my dream company wasn’t very difficult as I knew space mining would undoubtedly be the most profitable company if feasible in our modern day. However, I met the first challenge when creating a name. I knew that the name of the company would affect the logo greatly because from the start, I had wanted to incorporate the shapes and forms of the letters as part of the graphic. Eventually, I concluded on Mataero because it sounds like material but uses the spelling of aero to indicate space. I initially created a logo of a drill on a planet surface but decided to scrap that because it looked cheap and undeserving of a company potentially worth trillions. Eventually I used the double “A”s as rocket thrusters for a drill and was satisfied. I learned that it is alright to throw away an idea and start again even if it means taking more time to create a better piece of work. </p>
     <p>STORYBOARD (EXPECTATION EFFECTS)</p>
<p>I am particularly proud of my documentary storyboard because it incorporates subtle aspects of humor while illustrating the story. More often than not, documentaries can seem boring and are more attributed to lectures accompanied by narration. However, I wanted to approach this assignment with the intention to create a documentary that was both informative about the expectation effect and entertaining at the same time. Using blunt narrative progression and making light of controversial subjects in the real world, I think I achieved this target relatively well. That is why I am proud of it. In the future, I would want to adapt my use of subtle humor into other projects that I work on where appropriate. Humor seems to be underrated and when used in moderation at the right places, can really enhance not just a storyboard but any project it is incorporated in. I believe that this will separate a boring presentation from one that pulls in the intended audience and creates an actual enjoyable experience instead. </p>
