    <p>It was Amazon Prime Day, so like the rest of the country, I knowingly subjected myself to the false belief that I was actually saving money while scrolling through the “only today!” deals page. Did I really NEED anything? Absolutelynot. Was I going to buy something because it says I’msupposedlysaving $10? Absolutely! And thus,I came upon a dealso good the muscles in my hands over took what was left of my rational brain. The originally $89.99 three packs of 5lb beads was on sale for the price of one! $13.71 for 15lbs of beads was too good of an offer, I was sold. At check-out I realized that the packages were too large to be delivered to my nearest Amazon Hub Lockers as I do not trust packages to be delivered to my apartment door due to the increase of package thieves in my area. That’s when my brilliant idea came to be, I’ll just ship it to my company’s mail room and just drive it home myself. After the two-day glorious shippinghad passed, I receivedtheemail notifying that I had a package for me in the mall room. I had unfortunately arrived to work late that day resulting in me having to park quite far from the building, in addition the mail room claimed that I had to take the boxes as they were occupying too much spacein the crowded room. Having no other choice,Ilugged the boxes one by one to my cubical. 2 down 1 more to go I heavedthe last box in, just as the bottom gave way. 5lbs of beans scattered the floor, just as my boss walked. Needless to say, I lost my job and am down 5lbs of beads. The remaining beads are great, I’m currently spending my unemployment time going for the Genius world record of longest string of beads. I removed a star for the poor quality of the third cardboard box. But aside from that I am very satisfied with the product.  </p>
