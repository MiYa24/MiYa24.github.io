   <p>      I’ve really enjoyed creating my website and learning to code and write HTML, to the point that I unknowingly spend hours looking up how to create certain effects. Similar to teaching myself how to master premier pro,  learning to create my website has allowed me to ride the frustration infused euphoric wave of trying to figure out why a code isn’t working, to the triumph that comes with finally making a code work, to being able to watch everything you had created in your mind come to life. I also appreciate the lessons about different aspects of the digital space and design that are discussed in class. Using GitHub was really new for me as my past experience was limited to middle school offline static web page making and very basic college java coding. With basic Java, everything I needed to write was on one page and allowed me to instantaneously see the results of my coding. Navigating GitHub was a bit of a challenge its self as I was not used to how detail oriented it was. Where each individual page was placed in individual folders which were placed in broader folders and so on. I was also not used to the slower update time which made testing out new codes a bit harder. But I was really intrigued and happy to learning about the Inspect feature on chrome that helps break down all the coding and even allows for temporary viewing of direct edits. </p>
<p>      In terms of revisions, my website design is wandering a bit off of my original design plan. I am realizing that the design I had wished to create is no match for my subconscious aesthetic preferences which are certainly pushing through. I always like to think of myself as a minimalist loving person. When scrolling through social media or magazines, I’m always attracted to the clean, solid monochrome minimal design of architecture, fashion, and photography. While I will indefinitely cringe away from bold colors and any sorts of patterns, I struggle to admit that perhaps my palette in reality tends to extend past the shades from black to white, and towards pastel type colors. I enjoy muted solid soft looks. Whether it be my current tri pastel color gradient water bottle that I fell in love with at first sight, or my grayscale wardrobe sprinkled with muted hues of the rainbow. While I battle to find my true aesthetic, my bio has not been revised as I feel that my design concept needs to mature a bit more before I am certain on what I should change in the introduction to myself. For my website I have included a photo for a more personable feel as well has a drop-down menu under work in progress as well as a second mini menu heading within the page for easier accessibility. My embedded fiction writing has remained the same as I had originally edited it after class before uploading it to box the first time. My design concept has change drastically as well as many aspects of my website as I continue to explore the possibilities and my own cravings of how I want my website to appear. </p>
<p>      In terms of design principles, I’ve incorporated highlighting by creating a colored background when hovering over menu items, as well as color changes in menu headings to signify which page one is currently viewing. I have also decided to create large margins in order to centralize my entire website making the field of view smaller for audiences allowing them to scan the content more quickly and with greater ease. This is opposed to having to look all the way from right to left since the primary optical area in down the diagonal center. I also plan to use iconic representation to complement each bullet list item in my introduction bio.</p>
<p>      The first thing I wish to do on my website is to play around with fonts and figure out which fonts would fit my themes. I also want to clean up and explore different layouts to best fit my theme and vision. Starting with the Work-in-Progress page, which is currently a bit scattered and not up to par with my design concept. I intend to look into other features such as a collapsible content in order to organize the page to achieve the optimal clean aesthetic. Also, in general I wish to explore more CSS features that I can utilize in improving my website. I am lastly, also looking forward to gaining knowledge of how to manipulate images in photoshop so I can customize the icon ideas I had for my bullet list. </p>
