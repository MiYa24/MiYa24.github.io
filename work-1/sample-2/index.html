    <h1>Design Concept Writing</h1>
    <p>Take #2 </p>
    <p>The design concept for this website will center around a theme of cotton candy meets pastel rose garden, meets the MoMA. My intention for this theme is to display both a clean and fresh atmosphere blended with the minimalistic elegance of a modern museum.  The main logo featuring my name was added to showcase a bit more personality to my website. It features a mature graceful font backed by a more rugged graphic which juxtaposes the soft gentle pink coloring of the graphic. The goal was to echo the mature grace I hope to exude, while acknowledging my more free-spirited artistic side, as well as my calm and reserved personality. I chose to include a more interactive menu bar to enable a more playful side to the website which is both engaging as well as functional in guiding the eye. My content is set upon a clean white background, like an elegant art gallery which showcases visuals rather than lines of text. I plan to section off the content in each page to allow for organized viewing such how one might feel within an art museum or even an observatory. The colors that follow my theme will mimic the seriousness of each page. Such that, my main introduction page will contain mostly shades of monochrome to echo the clean-cut professionalism that museums exude. More creative pages such as the embedding fiction page will allow for more spring floral pastel like colors that indulge in the slightly bubblier side of my aesthetic.</p>
    <p>Take #1 </p>
    <p>The website that I want to create for myself will have a more minimalistic design that is to the point but also pleasing to the eye. I hope to be able to guide a viewerâ€™s attention towards everything they need to see, accompanied by subtle yet helpful design elements to point them there. In terms of user experience, the website should follow a layout that is similar to other sites so that familiarity can transfer over towards the ease of use on my site. This includes hopefully a hamburger menu that expands and collapses to reveal the website pages and a landing page with content as you scroll down. I am still contemplating including footers or not. The content will be set upon a clean white background, almost like an elegant art gallery that showcases visuals rather than lines of text. The font will also likely be a font of mostly uniform width and most definitely a sans serif typeface. Overall, the website should speak to the viewer through my visual content rather than text on a page.</p>
