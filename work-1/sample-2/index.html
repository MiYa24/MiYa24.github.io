    <h2>Work in Progress 1</h2>
    <p>The website that I want to create for myself will have a more minimalistic design that is to the point but also pleasing to the eye. I hope to be able to guide a viewerâ€™s attention towards everything they need to see, accompanied by subtle yet helpful design elements to point them there. In terms of user experience, the website should follow a layout that is similar to other sites so that familiarity can transfer over towards the ease of use on my site. This includes hopefully a hamburger menu that expands and collapses to reveal the website pages and a landing page with content as you scroll down. I am still contemplating including footers or not. The content will be set upon a clean white background, almost like an elegant art gallery that showcases visuals rather than lines of text. The font will also likely be a font of mostly uniform width and most definitely a sans serif typeface. Overall, the website should speak to the viewer through my visual content rather than text on a page.</p>
