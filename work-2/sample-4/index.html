  <p>My imagined company is called MATAERO Industries. The reason for the company name is that it is a blend of two words, material and aerospace. When said together, the pronunciation sounds similar to the word “material”. This company specializes in space mining. Space mining is an industry that does not quite exist yet but it is speculated to be possible within the near future. The idea is to supply our planet, Earth, with raw materials mined from asteroids that are close to Earth. This is potentially a multi trillion dollar industry with benefits to both technology and humanity. This business exists as a B2B supplier and service. MATAERO will primarily serve global industries that need raw materials such as manufacturers, distributers, suppliers, and more.</p>
