 <p>As I continued to work on my website, I took a few moments here and there to step back and observe how the website looked as a whole. The website in its earlier iterations, unfortunately, lacked a unified and consistent feel throughout. I took it upon myself to go through and address those issues before further adding content. This helped to create my own design standards to be used throughout the site and saved time by not needing to go back and fix out of place styling later. </p>
 <p>Something specific I did to help with consistency was to ensure that all navigation links worked in a similar manner. Under Work-in-Progress 1, I have two tabs for each of my classwork samples. They were originally both pink however it was hard to tell which writing was being looked at. So I changed it to when clicked, these links would be highlighted pink and be seen as an active state, indicating that the current page is associated with that active link. Otherwise, the link is gray. I also removed the elevated effects in the menu as it was a bit unnecessary and was not executed well through the menu anyways.</p>
 <p>When adding content to Work-in-Progress 2, I made sure that the dropdown menu and the order of the photoshop assignments are both in chronological order. This may seem like an insignificant detail, but I believe that this method of organization ultimately is intuitive for whoever is using the site. I also used thumbnails on the main Work-in-Progress 2 page to allow the user to have a preview of what they would like to see before they go into that specific page. Diving deeper, for photoshop two and four, I decided to organize the pages with the assignment image on the left and the text on the right to make the best use of a widescreen monitor format when displaying information. This allows the user to view everything all on one page without needing to scroll down which I personally find convenient.</p>
	 <p>Moving on to the creation of the photoshop assignments, photoshop 1 was approached by first looking at all the examples provided in your box. I had first chosen one that I thought would be fun to play around with however I ultimately ditched that advertisement as I was struggling a bit to figure out how I’d creatively manipulate it. That’s when I went back to the box folder of advertisements and tried to imagine how each one could be modified based on what we learned in class. It didn’t take long for me to instantly choose the Corona Typewriter Company advert when it came up, mostly due to our current global pandemic. I decided that it would be quite morbidly humorous to spin this advert into one for the coronavirus as a mix of being a parody strongly supported by satire. After that fundamental idea was established in my head, I mostly used cutting and pasting letters to spell out new letters and phrases to bring my vision of the parody poster to life. </p>
	 <p>Photoshop 2 was a more straightforward idea in mixing two genres, one being comedy and the other superhero. Knowing the background of the characters of Thor and Loki, it makes the original movie title, “Step Brothers”, even more appropriate. </p>
	 <p>I initially started Photoshop 3, the storyboard, by trying to mimic a powerpoint slide format based on the Work-in-Progress Presentation. However, I scrapped that idea because I did not think it truly represented what a storyboard was supposed to achieve. I decided to keep most elements black to give the impression of a drawn continuity. The storyboard was based on the expectation effect and I intended to have my imaginary documentary be more of a graphical tour. There would be a narrator speaking about the topics as the graphical elements are animated throughout the video. The viewer would then be able to hear about each topic within the expectation effect accompanied by animated visuals to overall create a short documentary that is easy to digest and understand.</p>
	 <p>When thinking about my dream company and logo for photoshop 4, I wanted to create something that had a contemporary flat design that focused on the use of shapes and space. I did some research on other logos such as Fedex, where there is a hidden arrow between the E and x. I first chose the name MATAERO industries because it sounds like material, but it is actually a blend of two words, material and aerospace. This company is a space mining company so I thought that this name was a clever play on words. I then decided to focus on the shapes of the letters themselves while keeping in mind symbols that represented space mining. I realized that by blocking in the “A”s, I could create what looks like rocket thrusters. I topped it off with a drill tip to create a rocket drill type of spacecraft. I think this summarizes the intent of the company while maintaining a modern and legible look. </p>
	 <p>My Work-in-Progress Presentation website page was originally intended to be created by using a table in HTML. I had previously done this for some of my other pages on the website. However, this time I decided to use a combination of divs with CSS classes to create my grid for more customizability. I created 3 columns that would share the width of the page equally and found that this method also scaled responsively with different browser sizes. </p>
	 <p>As I keep working on the website, I keep learning new things along the way. I plan on applying those new techniques alongside web design principles to continually improve and develop my site.</p>
